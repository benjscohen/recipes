### Ingredients

* Olive oil
* 1 medium onion, very finely chopped
* 1 medium carrot, very finely chopped
* 2 sticks celery, very finely chopped
* 150 g ground beef (preferably 85% lean or less)
* 150 g ground pork
* 150 mL whole milk
* 150 mL medium-bodied red wine
* 1 star anise
* 1 bay leaf
* 5 g dried porcini mushrooms, re-hydrated, finely chopped, liquid strained and reserved
* 150 g concentrated tomato paste
* Salt

### Method

Heat a film of olive oil over medium heat. Then, add the onion, carrot, and celery with a pinch of salt. Cook the aromatics until they're very soft, the onions are translucent, but they are not burnt, about 10 to 15 minutes.

Then add the ground beef and pork, followed immediately by the milk. Use a spoon or spatula to break up the meat. Keep the heat on medium and cook the sauce until all the liquid has evaporated and the mixture begins to sizzle.

Add the wine plus the star anise and bay, and cook it until most of the liquid has evaporated and it no longer smells of alcohol. Then add the re-hydrated mushrooms and the strained liquid. Cook that down until the pan is one again fairly dry.

Make a space in the pan and add more olive oil, followed by the tomato paste. Cook and fry the tomato paste until it's a deep rust color. Then stir the tomato through the rest of the sauce. Add some of the water from cooking the pasta to dilute the sauce. It should be loose, but not watery. Then season to taste with salt. Remove and discard the star anise and bay. Serve immediately.
